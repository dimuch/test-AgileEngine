            Please complete this exercise and either provide us a zip file of the project or post it on a public repository such as github.<br>
            Use Angular4.<br>
            Set up the application to use router to provide 3 routes (list/view/edit).<br>
            Have each route use a dedicated component to bind data to the view file.<br>
            Call a service to retrieve and pass back data from a REST endpoint. Use these sample endpoints:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;1) http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users - list of users.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;2) http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1 - specific user’s data<br>
            Display data from the endpoint on the view (Resolves should be used)<br>
            Create a list view with links to a view that shows individual records<br>
            The individual record view should allow the ability to edit that information in a form(Reactive Forms are preferable) and send it back to an endpoint with some basic client validation.<br>
            Feel free to use Angular CLI.<br>
